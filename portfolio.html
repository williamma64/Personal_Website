          <p class="project_overview">Every year there is an event held by the company SparkFun. The even is called AVC, which is an acronym for Autonomous Vehicle Competition, or also known as SparkFunAVC. There are several competitions each year. UCSD IEEE likes to participate in the yearly Speed Demons competition as one of their yearly projects. The Speed Demon competition consists of track of asphalt with various obstacles. The goal is to complete the track and satisfy the obstacles.</p>

            <p>My group inherited a vehicle frame from last year's team, but we decided to take a different route than they had. Last year's team used a raspberry pi as it's main controller and used a GPS module for their SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm.</p>
            <p>Our team decided to do more from scratch and make our vehicle more autonomous than the last. We decided on using the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 as our main controller. We are using Ubuntu Linux with the ROS middleware. We used laser readings from our spinning lidar and the Hector SLAM package in ROS to create a local mapping. Then we requests to the vehicle to tell it where to go.</p>
            <p>Roles and assignments in this project were more fluid rather than structured. None of the group members have done a project of such a size or scope. My primary assignment was to learn as much as I could about SLAM, code all the frames portion of SLAM, and automate the process of starting our entire vehicle.</p>

          <h4>Websites</h4>
          <h5>Work In Progress</h5>
            <p class="project_overview">Websites have always been a good way of displaying information for those who want them. I have known about html for a while but I have never gotten into making anything. I thought it would be a good idea to learn html while creating a personal website for myself and maybe others in the future. </p>
          <div class="project_description">
            <p>First, I learned from the book <i>HTML & CSS by John Duckett</i>. I did all the exercises and made arbitrary html pages. Next, I learned CSS using the same book. The CSS part of the book seems more complex than the html part, but maybe I am not deep enough into html yet. But, for now, CSS has lots of design attributes and making design robust on a webpage seems like a lot of work.</p>
            <p>My next objective is to learn JavaScript, JQuery, Python, Django, Ruby, and RubyOnRails. I want to make a complex and robust WebApp, but I am not sure of what I currently want to do.</p>
