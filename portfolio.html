				<p><em>Every year there is an event held by the company SparkFun. The event is called AVC, which is an acronym for Autonomous Vehicle Competition, or also known as SparkFunAVC. There are several competitions each year. UCSD IEEE likes to participate in the yearly Speed Demons competition as one of their yearly projects. The Speed Demon competition consists of track of asphalt with various obstacles. The goal is to complete the track and satisfy the obstacles.</em></p>
				<p>My group inherited a vehicle frame from last year's team, but we decided to take a different route than they had. Last year's team used a raspberry pi as it's main controller and used a GPS module for their SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm.</p>
        <p>Our team decided to do more from scratch and make our vehicle more autonomous than the last. We decided on using the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 as our main controller. We are using Ubuntu Linux with the ROS middleware. We used laser readings from our spinning lidar and the Hector SLAM package in ROS to create a local mapping. We also created our own pathfinding algorithm using the longest viable distance as the most favorable path.</p>
        <p>Roles and assignments in this project were more fluid rather than structured. None of the group members have done a project of such a size or scope. My primary assignment was to learn as much as I could about SLAM, code all the frames portion of SLAM, write mathematic functions and obstacle avoidance, and automate the process of starting our entire vehicle.</p>

				<h4 class="text-center">Website</h4>
				<p><em>Websites have always been a good way of displaying information for those who want them. I have known about html for a while but I have never gotten into making anything. I thought it would be a good idea to learn html while creating a personal website for myself and maybe others in the future.</em></p>
				<p>I have read a book on HTML & CSS. After I finished my readings, I created a simple website. It was nice, but it did not look like how I wanted. I researched more and more about how to design my website. I learned about and started using Bootstrap and other CSS CDNs.</p>
				<p>I am pretty happy with what I have now for design. My next goal for my website is to create a web app and a webserver. I am not sure exactly what I want to do, but I am probably going to do it with Django and Python.</p>

				<p><em>For a project class, we gathered as groups and decided on a project that all of us liked. The project could be as niche as you wanted. The project had to be presented as a webapp, Android app, or an iOS app.</em></p>
				<p>So, my group and I picked the concept of creating a recipe app. The difference with this recipe app is that you put in ingredients that you had on hand. The app would use the ingredients and try to find recipes based on the ingredients. There were also other features like filters, recipe search, and nutritional information.</p>
				<p>I worked on all the documentation we had to submit such as the design use cases, system test plan, user stories, sample screens, and etc. I also worked on the MyIngredients portions of the app which included adding and removing ingredients, the pantry, and some Firebase requests.</p>
				<p>This project was also difficult for me because I had to use two new technologies: Firebase and Android Studio. I had no prior experience using either of these technologies, so I had to watch videos and read introductory materials on both. The app came out pretty well. We had completed most of the functionality we had planned to create. There were still minor bugs when we presented it, but, in general, it was what we had envisioned.</p>
